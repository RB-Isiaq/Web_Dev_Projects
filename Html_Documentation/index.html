        <header>What is HTML?</header>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
        <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" and many others.</p>
        <p> An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<code><</code>" and "<code>></code>". The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <code><</code><code>title></code>, tag can be written as "
        <code><</code><code>Title></code>, 
        <code><</code><code>TITLE></code>
        , or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.</p>

        <h3>Anatomy of an html elements</h3>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="html element">
        <p>The main part of our elements are as follows: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
          <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
          <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
          <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
          </ol>
        <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following: </p>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="html attribute">
        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, <code>class</code> is the attribute name and <code>editor-note</code> is the attribute value. The <code>class</code> attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same <code>class</code> value) with style information and other things.</p>
        <p>An attribute should always have the following: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
          <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
          <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
        </ol>

 <ul>
          <li><code><</code><code>!DOCTYPE html></code> — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.</li>
          <li>
<code><</code><code>html></code><code><</code><code>/html></code> — the <code><</code><code>html></code> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.</li>
          <li><code><</code><code>head></code><code><</code><code>/head></code> — the <code><</code><code>head></code> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</li>
          <li><code><</code><code>meta charset="utf-8"></code> — This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this and it can help avoid some problems later on.</li>
          <li><code><</code><code>meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"></code> — This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.</li>
          <li><code><</code><code>title></code><code><</code><code>/title></code> — the <code><</code><code>title></code> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</li>
          <li><code><</code><code>body></code><code><</code><code>/body></code> — the <code><</code><code>body></code> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>
      
      
      <section class="main-section" id="Images">
        <header>Images</header>
        
          <div>
           <code><</code><code>img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"></code>
           </div>
        <p>The <code><</code><code>img></code> element embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.</p>
        <p>We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In the alt attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.</li>
          <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you should see something like this in place of the image:</li> <br>
          <code id="test-img">My test image</code>
          </ol>
        <p>The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys.</p>
      </section>
      
      
      <section class="main-section" id="Headings">
        <header>Headings</header>
        <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, <code><</code><code>h1></code> - <code><</code><code>h6></code>, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most: </p>
        <div>
        <code><</code><code>!-- 4 heading levels: --></code>
        <code class="block"></code>
    <code><</code><code>h1></code><code>My main title</code><code><</code><code>/h1></code>
    <code class="block"></code>
    <code><</code><code>h2></code><code>My top level heading</code><code><</code><code>/h2></code>
    <code class="block"></code>
    <code><</code><code>h3></code><code>My sub heading</code><code><</code><code>/h1></code>
    <code class="block"></code>
    <code><</code><code>h4></code><code>My sub-subheading</code><code><</code><code>/h4></code>
    </div>
        <p class="note">Note: Anything in HTML between <code><</code><code>!-- and --></code> is an HTML comment. The browser ignores comments as it renders the code. In other words, they are not visible on the page - just in the code. HTML comments are a way for you to write helpful notes about your code or logic.</p>
        </section>
     
     
     <section class="main-section" id="The_Paragraph_element">
        <header>The Paragraph element</header>
        <p>The <code><</code><code>p></code> HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.</p>
        <p>Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing <code><</code><code>/p></code> tag.</p>
        <div><code><</code><code>p></code>This is a single paragraph<code><</code><code>/p></code>
        </div>
       </section>
      
      
      <section class="main-section" id="Lists">
       <header>Lists</header>
        <p>A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a <code><</code><code>ul></code> element.</li>
          <li>Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an <code><</code><code>ol></code> element.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each item inside the lists is put inside an <code><</code><code>li></code> (list item) element.</p>
        </section>
      
      
      <section class="main-section" id="Links">
        <header>Links</header>
        <p>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — <code><</code><code>a></code> — "a" being the short form for "anchor".</p>
          <div><code><</code><code>a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</code><code><</code><code>/a></code></div>
          </code> </div>
        <p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.</p>
        <p class="note">Note: href might appear like a rather obscure choice for an attribute name at first. If you are having trouble remembering it, remember that it stands for hypertext reference.</p>
        </section>
      
      
      <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_elements">
        <header>Nesting elements</header>
        <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <code><</code><code>strong></code> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
         <div><code><</code><code>p></code>My cat is <code><</code><code>strong></code>very<code><</code><code>/strong></code> grumpy.<code><</code><code>/p></code></div>
        
        <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened the <code><</code><code>p></code> element first, then the <code><</code><code>strong></code> element; therefore, we have to close the <code><</code><code>strong></code> element first, then the <code><</code><code>p></code> element. </p>
        <p>The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another.</p>
        </section>
      

      <section class="main-section" id="Empty_elements">
        <header>Empty elements</header>
        <p>Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the <code><</code><code>img></code> element that we already have in our HTML page for example:</p>
         <div>
           <code><</code><code>img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"></code>
           </div>
        <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing <code><</code><code>/img></code> tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.</p>
